# Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis for Bank Branches Project 📊

This project aims to develop an automated sentiment analysis system for bank branches using data mining techniques. Our goal is to collect customer feedback to gain insights into their sentiments regarding banking services. The results of this sentiment analysis will provide valuable information to bank branches, allowing them to identify potential issues, enhance their customer service, and strengthen their competitive advantage. To achieve this, we rely on tools and technologies such as Apify, Airflow, BERT, PostgreSQL, and Power BI to collect, transform, store, and visualize data.


## Project Objectives 🎯

The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- Collect data from various sources.
- Apply advanced sentiment analysis using BERT.
- Store the results in a PostgreSQL database.
- Visualize the data using Power BI.
